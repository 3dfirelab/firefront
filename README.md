# ForeFire

<!-- ![logo](./doc/ForeFire.jpg) -->

`ForeFire` is an open-source code for wildland fire spread models, developed and maintained at Universit√© de Corse Pascal Paoli.

The complete paper can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278769168_ForeFire_open-source_code_for_wildland_fire_spread_models)


It has been designed and run on Unix systems, three modules can be built with the source code.

The main binaries are
  
  - An interpreter (executable)
  - A dynamic library (shared, with C/C++/Java and Fortran bindings)
  - Pre-Post processing helping scripts

## 1. Requirements

The folowing comands are suited for Ubuntu or Debian distributions.

### Update apt repository
```
sudo apt update
```

### C++ compiler
Compilation requires a c++ compiler, that usually comes pre-built with your linux distribution, but can be installed with
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### NetCDF Library 

```
sudo apt install libnetcdf-dev libnetcdf-cxx-legacy-dev
```

- NetCDF-C++ `legacy` is required for compatibilities issues

### Scons

The [SCons python tool](https://www.scons.org/) is used to make the executable and the python library
```
sudo apt get scons
```

## 2. Building the executable

A sample `SConstruct` file is included with the distribution.
Run it with
```
cd firefront

scons
```
The command will output a `CommandShell` file inside the `bin` directory

If it does not work, try using the `/tools/Sconstruct` file. Replace the `Sconstruct` file with `/tools/Sconstruct`. Set the environment variables, and insert the path to the Netcdf (and Java headers for JNI bindings if required).

## 3. Running an example

```
cd firefront/examples/aullene/

../../bin/CommandShell -i aullene.ff
```
The simulation result will be outputed in Json format

## 4. Building python Lib
The "swig" repository contains python bindings requires numpy (and numpy.i), swig, and matplotlib for testing. 

## 5. Building with Docker
A sample Dockerfile can allow to build a Docker image with
```
docker build . -t forefire
```

To run this image and interactively acces the continer use
```
docker run -it forefire bash
```
